(New) For windows + esp32 project:
---
First, create a high-level multi-step to-do list. Do not make all changes at once; perform them in order. Review the current project structure to ensure that the logic is centralized within a shared directory to avoid code duplication between the PC simulator and the ESP32 project.

Ensure the C++ code is modular with small code files, optimized for LVGL and ESP32S3-n16r8. You must strictly enforce the following general folder structure within the apps folders: core, ui, user_data, help, assets.  If a source file exceeds approximately 500 lines of code, try to breaking it down into smaller, functionally cohesive modules to improve maintainability. Design the apps strictly for a 240x240px window. The entire user interface must be fully navigable and operable using ONLY 4 buttons (Left, Right, Confirm, Cancel). Implement a hierarchical navigation logic: use Left/Right to traverse views or move focus, Confirm to drill down (Enter View > Select Widget > Edit Value), and Cancel to back out. Always visually highlight the focused element. The UI must be intuitive; keep definitions or guides exclusively in the help folder as markdown files.

To compile and test the Windows Simulator, use the following sequence in the root directory:
```
$env:PATH = "C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;C:\Espressif\tools\cmake\3.30.2\bin;$env:PATH"
cmake -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
cmake --build build --parallel
./bin/main.exe
```

To build and flash the ESP32-S3 execute:
```
cd ./esp32
$env:IDF_PATH = "C:\Users\raular5\esp\v5.5.1\esp-idf"
$env:IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH = "C:\Espressif\python_env\idf5.5_py3.11_env"
$env:PATH = "C:\Espressif\tools\ninja\1.12.1;C:\Espressif\tools\cmake\3.30.2\bin;C:\Espressif\tools\xtensa-esp-elf\esp-14.2.0_20241119\xtensa-esp-elf\bin;$env:PATH"
& "$env:IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH\Scripts\python.exe" "$env:IDF_PATH\tools\idf.py" build
& "$env:IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH\Scripts\python.exe" "$env:IDF_PATH\tools\idf.py" -p COM3 flash
```

Upon finishing your tasks and verifying the builds for both platforms, ALWAYS execute `./verify_execution.ps1` to receive the input from the user. Analyze the script's execution result: if you detect the exact log string `[USER_CONFIRMED]` in the output, you may conclude the project session. However, if that string is NOT present, you must read the content generated by the script, perform the instructions or fixes detailed therein, and then repeat this verification process.
Always write in English.
